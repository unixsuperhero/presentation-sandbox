For a while now, I've wanted to use this channel to discuss
different software principles and practices, or really
anything related to development.

One thing that's always held me back is code samples because
the code I wanna use is typically code I can't share.  But thanks to AI and
vibe-coding, not only do I have enough already, if I need
more I can just generate it.
