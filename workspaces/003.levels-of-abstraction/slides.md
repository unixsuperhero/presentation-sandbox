# Levels of Abstraction

---

# Intro

Let's look at what levels of abstraction are

and see a small example of a situation I've
seen often.

---

# Separation

- easily one of the more important techniques
    - many principles are separation-related
- often misunderstood
- lots of bad opinions that have somehow become
    popular opinion

---

# Why

- like everything: what, when, where, why, and how matter

---

A rule...

--------------

## Do not mix levels of abstractions
--------------

...a good reason to separate in terms of when, where, and why

# Levels of Abstraction

# Levels of Abstraction

- relative

# Levels of Abstraction

- relative
- where the code belongs on a spectrum from human to machine
    - human being HL
    - machine being LL

# Levels of Abstraction

- kind of link the storefront and warehouse of a store
    - a customer wants to:
        - find products
        - add products to cart
        - put item back
        - checkout
        - pay
        - enter
        - leave
    - a employee wants to:
        - in warehouse or "front of the house"
            - find products
            - ring up customer
            - charge customer
            - bag products
            - accept payment
            - deliver receipt
        - in warehouse or "back of the house"
            - find products
            - label products
            - store products
            - display products
