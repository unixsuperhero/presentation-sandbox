there's a very common mistake that almost every developer makes.

i call it procedural thinking.  and it's not so much a a mistake as much as it is a mindset.

and the problem with a mindset, is it's the mental framework or lens used to see the world.  it affects everything.  how you see the world, understand things, think, and solve problems.


# 2
procedural thinking is thinking about code as a series of steps or tasks.  a lot like a flow chart or sequence diagram.

another way to think about it is thinking about code as actively doing things.  it's an imperative mindset as opposed to a declarative mindset.

thinking procedurally is expected!  as soon as you learn conditionals and
control flow, who wouldn't think this way?

but there are inherent issues with thinking procedurally, and it clashes with OO and functional programming in a fundamental way.

which is why we're going to quickly review some basic concepts that every developer should understand. 

# 4

paradigm doesn't really matter here, but we are going to look at classes,
encapsulation, interfaces, abstractions, and levels of abstraction.

we aren't gonna cover them in depth.  i just want to give enough context to
paint a picture.

Classes!

A class is made up of attributes and methods.
Attributes are dayda, and methods are behavior.

But, I think this is flawed.  Sure, technically methods do things,
but sometimes a method is interchangable with the data it returns.
look up referential transparency, if you want to know more.

# 6

what is a class not?  well, a class is not just a container or box that you
throw code in.  it is supposed to embody an idea or concept, specifically a
thing.

# 7 ?

let's look at encapsulation.

in it's simplest form, encapsulation is just packaging data and behavior together.
but, it also encourages data hiding.  meaning, a class's attributes are
precious.  they should be treated carefully and the outside world should never
directly access or modify them.  so all interactions happen {V IY1 AH0} methods.
this is why setters and getters exist.

this helps create a controlled environment.  accessing or modifying an object's internal state is restricted in pre-defined ways.  this helps us prevent unexpected situations and unknown states.

good encapsulation has a lot of benefits.



# 8

interfaces ... ...

a method's interface is its name, arguments, and return value.  that's it ... ...

there are plenty of principles emphasizing that a method's interface is more important than it's implementation ... this may seem counter intuitive, but it's powerful.

remember, classes are made to be used, which means calling its methods.  so when you're working on a class, the focus shouldn't be solely on what's happening inside the class.  just as much, if not more attention should be given to the interface it makes available.

and similar to the way encapsulation and data hiding is with attributes, one method shouldn't know anything about another method's implemention.

now you might think that a method's code is the most important part.  that would be a rookie mistake.

this is where having a procedural mindset really starts to show.  if we call a method and can read its implementation, we usually will.  and 
when someone has a procedural mindset and they're creating a class, all the focus tends to be internal.
