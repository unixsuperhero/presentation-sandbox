there's this really common mistake.
it's so common that when ai generates code, it's also making this mistake.
which suggests that the majority of its training data is also making the
mistake.
that's how widespread it is.

i call it procedural thinking.
or thinking about programming and code as a sequence of actions.
like a flowchart or sequence diagram.
it actually more of a mindset than a mistake.

ultimately, thinking procedurally is the result of a lack of fundamentals.

either you never learned them,
don't understand them,
or you're ignoring them because, for whatever reason, you think they aren't relevant

so i'd like to quickly review a few concepts.
and along the way i'll tie in how it relates to procedural thinking.

here are the topics we will cover...
classes or modules.  and paradigm doesn't really matter, this is about mindset
then data and behavior,
encapsulation,
interfaces,
abstractions,
and levels of abstraction
