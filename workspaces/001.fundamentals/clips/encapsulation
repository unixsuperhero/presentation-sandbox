now let's look at encapsulation, which suggests that a class's attributes are
precious.  no other class should directly access its attributes.  this is why 
setters and getters are a thing.

all interactions and communication should happen via methods.  and these methods
form a contract.  all interactions are restricted to these pre-defined
interactions.  this creates a controlled environment and limits the possibility
of unknown states or unexpected situations.

this lets us tightly control the data.  but encapsulation suggests one other
thing.
other classes shouldn't know anything about a method's implementation either.

when the outside world knows how a method is implemented, it will do special
things to accomodate that implementation, and this is how you get tight
coupling.  because when that implementation changes, those other classes now have
to change as a result.  it's not just for the caller either.  if a method knows
who's calling it, then it might also do special things for the caller.

with procedural thinking, making methods is less of a priority.  and even if you
make methods, ...and even if you expose those methods to other classes, their
real intention is for internal use.  which means they specifically exist to
support the procedure. remember classes and methods are made to be used.

but it also means that the two methods know too much about how the other one
works, violating encapsulation.  so inputs and outputs, or worse, side-effects
are tailored to be used in very specific scenarios.
