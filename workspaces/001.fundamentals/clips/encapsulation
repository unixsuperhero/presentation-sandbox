now let's look at encapsulation, which suggests that a class's attributes are
precious.  no other class should directly access its attributes.  that's why we
have setters and getters.

all interactions and communication should happen via methods.  but not only
should other classes not access attributes, other class's shouldn't know
anything about a method's implementation.

when the outside world knows how a method is implemented, it will do special
things to accomodate that implementation, and this is how you get tight
coupling.  because when that implementation changes, the other classes now have
to change as a result.
