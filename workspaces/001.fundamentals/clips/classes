first and foremost, a class is not just a container or box that you throw code
in.
it's supposed to encapsulate or represent an idea.
more specifically...a thing.

a class is definitely not supposed to encapsulate a procedure.

it should be more about what a class is, rather than what a class does.

a class is made up of attributes and methods, or data and behavior.
attributes being the data.  now, people will tell you that methods are behavior,
and while that can be true, i think it's a flawed explanation.
methods can just as easily represent data.
