which is why interfaces is the next topic.

so, from the outside, a class shouldn't know anything about how another class
works.  all it should know is it's interface, or API.

the interface of a method is it's name, it's inputs or arguments, and it's
output or return value.  that's it: name, input, output.

there are many ideas that suggest interfaces are more important than
implementations.  for example, blackbox programming or design by contract.
when another class is coupled to the interface, than the implementation can
change freely and it won't be affected.

one problem with procedures and procedural thinking, is all the focus is
inherently placed on the implementation.  another problem is side-effects.  less
importance is placed on return values and what becomes important is the
side-effects.

remember classes are made to be used.  let's look at an AI generated code sample
and see what the interface tells us.
