which is why interfaces is the next topic.

so, from the outside, a class shouldn't know anything about how another class
works.  all it should know is it's interface, or API.

the interface of a method is it's name, it's inputs or arguments, and it's
output or return value.  that's it.

interfaces are more important than implementations.
when another class is coupled to the interface, than the implementation can
change freely and it won't be affected.

the problem with procedures and procedural thinking, is all the focus is on the
implementation.

remember classes are made to be used.  let's look at some ai generated code and
see what the interface tells us.
