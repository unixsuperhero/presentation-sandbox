let's take a second to compare the properties of data and behavior.

procedures are contextual and inherently have a form of coupling called temporal
coupling.  this means that the order matters.

data, on the other hand, is context-free.  it may hold state, but data itself
is stateless, it's informations, it just is.  so it's much more reusable
